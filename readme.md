!!! This project currently doesn't work properly don't bother with this until I learn how to make this work!!!

The purpose of this project is to create dice tray objects that contain dice strings which can be rolled repeatedly optionally with disadvantage/advantage.  Note that the latter part only affects d20.  

Result objects will be returned which will contain an integer sum and a string showing breakdowns per dice.

Please read the `test/test.test.ts` file to learn usage of this code.
